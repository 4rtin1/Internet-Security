<section class="bg">
	<div class="hidden">
		<p>The I Love You virus, also known as the Love Letter or LoveBug worm, was a notorious cyberattack that occurred in May 2000. Originating from the Philippines, the virus was created by Onel de Guzman, a computer programming student. It spread through email, using social engineering techniques to entice unsuspecting users to open an attachment titled "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.txt.vbs". The filename exploited the default Windows settings at the time, which hid file extensions for known file types, making it appear as a harmless text file to the user.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="bg">
	<div class="hidden">
		<p>Once the file was opened, the Visual Basic Script (VBS) worm infected the user's computer by overwriting files with various extensions such as .jpg, .mp3, and .doc, rendering them useless. The worm also propagated itself by sending copies to all contacts in the victim's Microsoft Outlook address book, leading to an exponential increase in infections. In some cases, the virus also attempted to download a password-stealing program that could harvest login credentials from the infected machine.</p>

<section class="bg">
	<div class="hidden">
		<p>At its peak, the I Love You virus affected millions of computers across the globe, causing an estimated $10 billion in damages and generating substantial disruption to businesses, government institutions, and individual users. The virus forced several large organizations, including the Pentagon, CIA, and the UK Parliament, to temporarily shut down their email systems to contain the spread. The incident highlighted the vulnerabilities in computer systems and the potential for rapid propagation through email and social engineering tactics.</p>
